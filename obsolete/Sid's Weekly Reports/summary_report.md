# Rubin Rhapsodies Summary Report:



Rubin Rhapsodies is a project that is prototyping a method of sonifying Rubin data; turning data into sound.  The motivation for this project is to see how else we can interpret Rubin data, with or without visualizations. One benefit of this, is sonifications can allow for people who cannot interact with the data visually, to do so in an auditory format. This leads to different ways of interactions and gives more people access to the data Rubin Observatory provides. This data is for everyone, so everyone should have a way to work with it. Sonifications can also be pleasant and interesting to hear for the public, which can be one avenue for public outreach. There is not a single or standard way of mapping data features to sound properties, so this project can be quite open ended on how  sonifications turn out after different feature mappings. However, one caveat of this is that some mapping decisions may lead to unintended biases in the sound, which may impact the data's inherent need to stay true/speak for itself. Rubin data is quite complex and mapping all the information it provides is a difficult task, but in spite of this, there are many sound properties available to the feature mapping, which can allow us to incorporate more information from the Rubin data into sonifications.
