# Siddharth Patel - Week of 07/02/2021 - Report 3



## 1. Work done

### 1.1 Papers Read
---

Logic Pro X Tutorial [[Link](https://www.musicianonamission.com/logic-pro-x-tutorial/)]: Gave a general overview on all the basic features of Logic Pro X (advanced version of garageband), that I could use for the sound files made by the Astronify notebook. Fading, editing MIDI, strength, using interface, etc


---


### 1.3 Other
Presentation: Gave presentation on work done so far on sonifying the PLAsTiCC light curves, made plans to complete the slides more for own use and possible discussion with people who work with sonification in general.





## 2. Figures (at least 1 figure)

**No figures this week, but rather sound clips!**

## 3. Results

Based on the reading *The Sound of Data* from last week, the idea was to use more advanced audio editing software, to work on feature mapping the audio clips made from the Astronify notebook. It started off productive using instruments to differentiate the different bands, but over the course of the week it became clear that manually editing the clips wasn't too intuitive, and doing it systematically through code would be better. 





## 4. Planning

Make the presentation slides more complete with more info and description of what we are doing, for documentation and possibly for future presentations.

Make a more complete table of feature mapping data to sound, and read more about sonification techniques in general.
