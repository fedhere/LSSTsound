**Lobbying for the ear : the public fascination with andacademic legitimacy of the sonification of scientific data** [[Link](https://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/706794/guid-f9e34ec6-b0f4-4618-9d2b-cbf321bebc6e-ASSET1.0.pdf)]: Read chapters two and three. Ch2 was about the history of sonification and five examples from geoscience, astrophysics, high energy physics, neurology, and genetics. Overall the info wasn't too specific on anything we needed, but one thing that stood out was "Being true to the data". This reminds us that though we pick how to map our data to sound and have aesthetic control, this control should not be abused to the point the data loses meaning. Ch3 talked about ICAD and their conferences, and a standard definition of sonification, but overall not too helpful for our work.

## 2. Figures (at least 1 figure)

*This week I generated sound clips from the PLAsTiCC using the sonify code I found last week.*

Here is the link  to the Jupyter notebook that plays the sonifications (at the bottom of the notebook): [[GitHub Link](https://github.com/fedhere/RubinRhapsodies/blob/main/newSonify.ipynb)]

## 3. Results

This week was mainly about getting the sonify repository code to work with the PLAsTiCC data, which I did successfully! Afterwards I read through the sonification thesis paper (Ch2/3) but I didn't see enough info that would be helpful to us on this project.

## 4. Planning

Read Ch4 of the sonification thesis paper and report on any noteworthy things.

Sonify SNIBC objects that peak in the 2/3 observation periods and limit data values to that period.

Make presentation slides for the project more complete, if meeting with Professor Bianco's contact happens.
