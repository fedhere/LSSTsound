# Siddharth Patel - Week of 07/09/2021 - Report 4



## 1. Work done

### 1.1 Papers Read
---

**Creating music based on quantitative data from variable stars** [[Arxiv Link](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1811/1811.02930.pdf)]: This paper showed how they converted magnitudes of stars and normalized them into musical notes. Generally it wasn't too helpful of a read at first, but after I found the sonify GitHub, some code made more sense because it also used some normalization, which helped me understand the code a bit more.

### 1.3 Other
**Erin Braswell - Python Data Sonification for Science and Discovery - PyCon 2018** [[YouTube Link]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EXvR1shVFQ)[[GitHub Link](https://github.com/erinspace/sonify)]: This talk about data sonification gave an example of sonifying light curves from Kepler data, which actually systemized everything we did with exporting audio files into an audio editor, and instead played the sonification within the jupyter notebook. This seems really promising for what we want to do with the passbands. So for this upcoming week the plan is to make this sonify repository work with the PLAsTiCC data.





## 2. Figures (at least 1 figure)

**Some plots made which were inspired from the sonify repository example notebook**

*Helped me understand matplotlib better, and overall a neat way to visualize the PLAsTiCC data*:

## 3. Results

Overall a good week for figuring out the next steps of systematically sonifying the PLAsTiCC Data. Though the major breakthrough was finding the sonify repository, other than that the reading and other searching I did was not too helpful, but a good amount of progress is underway for next week and I should have a couple sound clips to show.





## 4. Planning

Making use of the sonify repository to sonify the PLAsTiCC data and produce sound clips.

Read Chapters 3 and 4 of the Sonification thesis paper and summarize/take notes of important points
